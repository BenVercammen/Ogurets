dherkin
=======
Gherkin parser and executer for dart
Currently provides basic Cucumber-like functionality
for Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

Usage
-----
Write gherkin and invoke the runtime.
Copy and paste generated step defs
implemnent!

Caveat
------
Currently, there is no way to programatically import dart sources.
This means that all step def providing files need to be manually imported.  :(
