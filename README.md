dherkin
=======
Gherkin parser and runner for dart.
Currently provides basic Cucumber-like functionality
for Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

Usage
-----
Write gherkin and invoke the runtime.
Copy and paste generated step defs.
Implement!

Caveat
------
Currently, there is no way to procedurally import dart sources.
This means that all step def providing files need to be manually imported.  :(
